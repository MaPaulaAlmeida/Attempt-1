            <h2>Beginnings</h2>
            <p>
              I spent my early years in Quito, Ecuador, surrounded by volcanoes
              and the warmth of family. My days were filled with
              curiosity—sketching on any scrap of paper I could find and
              inventing stories about the world around me. Those simple,
              imaginative moments became the foundation for my creative
              passions, even before I knew what they were future.

            <h2>Becoming</h2>
            <p>
              As a teenager, I began exploring who I was and what I wanted to
              become. I was drawn to photography, drawing, and storytelling,
              slowly realizing how much I loved bringing ideas to life. Yet, I
              also faced moments of doubt, unsure if these passions could truly
              shape my future. It was a time of learning, not just in school,
              but about myself.

            <h2>Transitions</h2>
            <p>
              Graduating from high school in Quito marked the end of one chapter
              and the start of another. I was excited, but uncertainty lingered,
              and the fear of the unknown crept in. What lay ahead felt unclear,
              but deep down, I knew I wanted to grow beyond my comfort zone and
              embrace whatever challenges came next.

            <h2>New Paths</h2>
            <p>
              Moving from Quito to Porto, Portugal, was a leap into the unknown,
              filled with both excitement and fear. Learning a new language,
              navigating a different culture, and being far from home tested me
              in ways I never imagined. Yet, these challenges pushed me to grow,
              teaching me resilience and revealing opportunities I never thought
              possible.

            <h2>Now & Back Then</h2>
            <p>
              Now, I’m studying Audiovisual Communication and Multimedia,
              immersing myself in creativity and growth. Each project refines my
              skills and brings me closer to the life I envision. With every
              step, I’m learning to embrace the balance between uncertainty and
              opportunity, building a future that feels meaningful.<br />
