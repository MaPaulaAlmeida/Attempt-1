# READ ME FILE: María Paula's Portfolio.

This portfolio represents a brief journey through my 18 years of life, focused mainly on my present as a student of **Audiovisual Communication and Multimedia.** Through this project, I want to share the journey from my first studies to the interests that have inspired me throughout this time.

With a simple but attractive concept, when you enter the portfolio you can see a universe, where the moon is the protagonist and an astronaut is near it. Astronomy has been a passion of mine since I was a child, so I couldn't miss it in the design. In the center of the page is a welcome, and at the top, the navigation bar offers buttons to access the home page and the other two sections. As a detail, in the upper left corner appears *“Maria Lua”*, my artistic name.

**Part I** is organized as a timeline, reflecting how the different stages of my life have influenced my professional path. From my childhood in Quito, where my first creative passions were born, to my adolescence, when I discovered photography and art. I wanted to show how, despite the uncertainty and challenges, each step pushed me out of my comfort zone. Moving to Porto was a key point that strengthened my resilience, and today, studying Audiovisual Communication and Multimedia, I seek to continue exploring new opportunities and build the future I imagine.
In **Part II**, I wanted to show the elements that define who I am, on Earth (continuing with the concept of the universe). Here, I highlight how movies, travel and photography have been essential in my development. Films inspired me to study Audiovisual Communication, travel taught me about diversity and new perspectives, and photography allows me to tell stories through my personal vision. Each of these influences has enriched my creativity.

For both parts, I took meaningful images. In **Part I**, the photos of my family and me were taken in my senior year of high school, and the last slide was taken during a visit to the Porto Bridge. In **Part II**, I created collages; including pictures I have taken but not yet published in the slide of this theme. Both sections have buttons that allow you to go forward or backward through the slides so that the user has control over time. As *contact* information, my email address appears in the last slide of **Part I**, and the link to my *Instagram photo account* is in the part dedicated to this topic in **Part II**.

This portfolio was made with *VSCode and Github, using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.* The basis for the concepts came from the Web *Applications Class*, but I also got help from YouTube tutorials and AI chats.
